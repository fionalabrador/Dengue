            <h2 class="section-header2"><br>Overview</h2>
           
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. But the disease has been spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe and southern parts of the United States.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. For now, in areas where dengue fever is common, the best ways to prevent infection are to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take steps to reduce the mosquito population.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header1"><b> 5 Things you need to know..</b></h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the worldwide prevalence of dengue, it’s imperative that you arm yourself with important facts relating to this viral disease. These are 10 things that you need to know about dengue to help you gear up against the disease:</p>

            <h3 class="section-header3">1. Dengue fever is most common in sub-tropical and tropical areas</h3>
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dengue outbreaks occur in several countries, including the Americas, Africa, the Middle East, <b>Asia</b>, and the Pacific Islands. In fact, the only continent that is not affected by dengue is Antartica. It can occur anytime and anywhere as long as warm weather conditions favour mosquito survival and the mosquitoes are active.</p>
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest risk for dengue occurs in the following areas which are known to have sub-tropical and tropical climates:</p>
            <ol class="section-paragraph">
                <li>Africa</li>
                <li>Southeast Asia</li>
                <li>Southeren China</li>
                <li>The Pacific Islands</li>
                <li>The Caribbean<i>(except Cuba and the Cayman Islands)</i></li>   
                <li>Central and Southern America<i>(except Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina)</i></li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="section-header3">2. Dengue is spread by a specific species of mosquito</h3>
                    <img class ="image-box" src="Images/img1.jpg" alt="Aedes Aegypti Mosquito" >
        
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dengue is transmitted through the bite of the Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main vector that causes dengue. However, dengue outbreaks have also been attributed to Aedes albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis, and several species of the Aedes scutellaris complex. The Aedes aegypti is most active during the day. They tend to bite approximately 2 hours after sunrise and in the evening before the sun sets.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-header3">3. <i>Aedes Mosquitos</i> breed in stagnant water</h3>
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosquitoes thrive in urban areas close to human population. They prefer to breed in clean, stagnant water that is easily found in the household. All it takes is a very small amount of water for mosquitoes to lay their eggs. Examples where stagnant water can be found include water bottles, containers, discarded waste, or anything that is capable of holding water. Inside the home, adult mosquitoes can be found in dark areas such as closets, under beds, and behind curtains where they are protected from wind, rain, and potential predators.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header3">4. You can get the dengue virus more than once</h3>
                    <img class ="image-box"  src="Images/img2.jpg" alt="Scratch" >
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that you can get the dengue virus more than once. The virus responsible for causing dengue is called dengue virus (DENV). There are 4 DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), which means it is possible to be infected 4 times. While recovery from infection is believed to provide lifelong immunity against that serotype, cross-immunity to the other stereotypes is only partial and temporary. It’s also important to note that a second infection carries a higher risk of developing severe dengue which can be fatal.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header3">5. It can be fatal when left untreated</h3>
            <p class="section-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many dengue infections are mild, it can cause acute flu-like illness which can develop into severe dengue. Severe dengue, also known as dengue shock syndrome (DSS), is a potentially lethal complication and will require hospitalisation and management by medical professionals. Dengue shock symptoms occur after 2 – 6 days if the patient remains untreated.</p>
            <b class="section-paragraph">Dengue shock syndrome symptoms include:</b>
            <ul class="section-paragraph">
                <li>Fainting</li>
                <li>A weak pulse</li>
                <li>Blueness around the mouth</li>
                <li>Cold/clammy hands and feet</li>
            </ul>

                <li>For people who get sick with dengue, symptoms can be mild or severe.</li>
                <li>Severe dengue can be life-threatening within a few hours and often requires care at a hospital.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-header2">Symptoms</h2>
                    <img class ="image-box" src="Images/img3.jpg" alt="Scratch">
            <ul class="section-paragraph">
                <li>Mild symptoms of dengue can be confused with other illnesses that cause fever, aches, and pains, or a rash.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-paragraph">The most common symptom of dengue is <b>fever</b> with any of the following:</p>
            <ul class="section-paragraph">

            <h1 class="section-header1">Dengue Transmission</h1>
            <h2 class="section-header2">Through Mosquito Bites</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Dengue viruses are spread to people through the bites of infected Aedes species mosquitoes <i>(Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus)</i>.  These are the same types of mosquitoes that spread Zika and chikungunya viruses.
            </p>
            <ul class="section-paragraph">
                <li>These mosquitoes typically lay eggs near standing water in containers that hold water, like buckets, bowls, animal dishes, flower pots, and vases.</li>
                <li>These mosquitoes prefer to bite people, and live both indoors and outdoors near people.</li>
                <li>Mosquitoes that spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika bite during the day and night.</li>
                <li>Mosquitoes become infected when they bite a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="section-header2">From Mother to Child</h2>
            <ul class="section-paragraph">
                <li>A pregnant woman already infected with dengue can pass the virus to her fetus during pregnancy or around time of birth.
                </li>
                <li>To date, there has been one documented report of dengue spread through breast milk. Because of the benefits of breastfeeding, mothers are encouraged to breastfeed even in areas with risk of dengue.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-header2"> Through infected blood, laboratory, or healthcare setting exposures.</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Rarely, dengue can be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplant, or through a needle stick injury.</p>
